    2.  **✅ "Drawing Plan" JSON format:** Rich schema supporting complex mechanical drawings
        - Geometry: lines, circles, arcs, rectangles
        - Annotations: dimensions, symbols, notes
        - Title blocks: complete drawing metadata
    3.  **✅ "DXF from Plan" Engine:** Converts JSON plans to professional DXF drawings
    4.  **✅ SVG Symbol Integration:** Symbols render as geometric outlines with labels
    5.  **✅ Visualization Pipeline:** PNG generation for preview/validation

*   **Outcome of Phase 1:** ✅ **ACHIEVED** - Complete, production-quality drawing generation
    ```bash
    python generator.py --plan ./plans/complex_flange.json --visualize
    # ✅ Generates: 150×100mm flanged coupling with 5 mounting holes,
    #               4 GD&T symbols, weld callouts, title block
    ```

### **Phase 2: The AI Creative Director & Drawing Synthesizer** ✅ **COMPLETED**

**Prerequisites:** ✅ All Phase 1 deliverables complete  
**Foundation Ready:** ✅ JSON schema proven with complex drawings

*   **Functionality We Built:**

    *   **✅ Prompt Engineering:** System prompts for creative and accurate engineering drawing generation.
    -   **✅ Validation Layer:** Implicitly handled by detailed prompting and schema.

*   **Implementation Plan:** ✅ **ACHIEVED**
    1.  **✅ Develop a "Prompt Factory":** Created `prompt_factory.py` to synthesize prompts.
    2.  **✅ AI-Powered "Prompt-to-Plan" Translation:** Integrated LLM to interpret prompts into valid JSON plans.
    3.  **✅ Integrate into Master Script:** Extended `generator.py` with a `--random` mode.

    python generator.py --random --api-key "YOUR_KEY"
    # ✅ Generates: Random Prompt → JSON plan → DXF + PNG visualization
    ```

**Next Steps:** Ready for Phase 3 or new feature development.

---

### **Phase 2.5: Guaranteed Schema via AI Tool Calling** ✅ **COMPLETED**

**Problem Statement:** Our previous approach of asking the AI to generate raw JSON based on instructions in a prompt has proven brittle. The AI frequently forgets required fields or creates structurally invalid data, causing downstream failures.

**The Solution (User-Identified):** Instead of relying on prompt engineering alone, we now use the native **OpenAI Tool Calling** feature. This allows us to define our `DrawingPlan` as a strict JSON Schema. The AI is now constrained by the API to generate an object that conforms to this schema, effectively eliminating structural validation errors. Our system prompt now focuses on guiding the AI to produce semantically correct *values* within that guaranteed structure.

*   **Architectural Shift:** ✅ **ACHIEVED**
    *   **From:** `Prompt → AI (text) → Manual JSON Parsing → Validation`
    -   **To:** `Prompt → AI (with Tool Schema) → Structured JSON Object (API-Validated) → Semantic Validation`

*   **Implementation Plan:** ✅ **ACHIEVED**
    1.  **✅ Define the Tool:** In `ai_planner.py`, created a `tools` array containing a single tool named `create_drawing_plan`.
    2.  **✅ Codify the Schema:** Defined the complete parameters of our drawing plan using JSON Schema, including conditional requirements for different dimension types.
    3.  **✅ Refactor the API Call:** Modified the `create_plan_from_prompt` function to include the `tools` and `tool_choice` parameters in the API call.
    4.  **✅ Parse the Response:** Updated the response handling logic to extract the JSON object from the `tool_calls` field.
    5.  **✅ Refine the System Prompt:** The system prompt now focuses on high-level engineering principles and strict adherence to the defined schema types.

*   **Target Outcome:** ✅ **ACHIEVED** - A highly reliable AI Planner that always returns a structurally valid JSON Drawing Plan, significantly increasing the success rate of the entire pipeline.

**Next Steps:** Ready for Phase 3 or new feature development.

---

### **Phase 3: The Semantic Engine** ✅ **COMPLETED**

**Problem Statement:** The AI is now producing structurally valid JSON, but the drawings are still not semantically or geometrically correct. The AI "draws a line" for a rib instead of creating a feature that provides structural reinforcement. It lacks a true model of engineering intent. This is the final and most important bottleneck.

**The Solution:** We will evolve our architecture from a primitive-based system to a **feature-based system**. We will teach our software what a "rib" or a "fillet" is, and the AI's job will be simplified to asking for these features, rather than trying to construct them from scratch out of lines and arcs.

*   **Architectural Shift:**
    *   **New JSON Schema:** A high-level, feature-based schema has been designed.
        -   **Example:** `{ "base_feature": { "type": "plate", "width": 100 }, "modifying_features": [ { "type": "hole", "diameter": 20 } ] }`
    *   **Intelligent Geometry Engine:** `generator.py` has been refactored from a simple renderer into an engine with functions like `create_base_feature()` and `apply_modifying_features()`. The burden of geometric calculation has moved from the AI to our code.
    *   **Simplified AI Task:** The AI Planner will be updated to use the new, simpler, feature-based schema. Its job is now to request features, not to draw lines.

*   **Implementation Progress:** ✅ **ACHIEVED**
    1.  **✅ Feature-Based Schema:** A new `feature_based_plate.json` was created to serve as the blueprint for the new engine.
    2.  **✅ Semantic Engine Foundation:** `generator.py` was refactored with a new engine path, separate from the legacy renderer.
    3.  **✅ Base Feature Generation:** The engine can create base features (e.g., `plate`).
    4.  **✅ Modifying Feature Generation:** The engine can apply modifying features, including **holes** and **fillets**, which correctly alter the base geometry.
    5.  **✅ Feature-Based Annotations:** A new annotation system was created to dimension parts based on their high-level features (e.g., "bottom edge").
    6.  **✅ Validator Upgrade:** The `plan_validator.py` was upgraded to be backward-compatible and validate both legacy and new feature-based plans.

*   **Current Status:** The core Semantic Engine is functional and can successfully render a complex, multi-feature part from a high-level plan.

*   **Target Outcome:** A system that produces geometrically and semantically correct drawings that are suitable for manufacturing, bridging the final gap between a "drawing" and a "design."

*   **Final Implementation Results:** ✅ **FULLY ACHIEVED**
    1.  **✅ Integrate DXF Symbol Library** - Successfully integrated DXF block library
        -   **Solution:** `src/symbol_integration/block_importer.py` with direct block importing
