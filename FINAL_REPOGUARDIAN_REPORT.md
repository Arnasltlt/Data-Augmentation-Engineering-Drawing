   - ✅ Fully functional placement engine
   - ✅ Collision detection working
   - ✅ Mock symbol support implemented
   - ✅ Performance meets requirements

3. **GrungeWorks** (Noise Pipeline)
   - ✅ Complete noise filter implementation
   - ✅ CLI interface functional
   - ✅ PDF-to-PNG processing capability
   - ✅ Multiple noise level presets

4. **QualityGate** (Testing & Validation)
   - ✅ 5 comprehensive test suites created
   - ✅ License compliance testing
   - ✅ Schema validation tests
   - ✅ Collision detection tests

5. **CLI-Ops** (Command Interface)
   - ✅ Main generator CLI working
   - ✅ Fixed dependency issues
   - ✅ Graceful Ray fallback implemented
   - ✅ Help system functional
